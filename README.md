## Bandit Algorithms Comparison

This repository contains code for comparing two popular multi-armed bandit algorithms: Epsilon Greedy and Thompson Sampling. The comparison is done based on their performance in a simulated bandit problem.

## Contents

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for running the bandit algorithm experiments and visualizing the results.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the Python packages required to run the code in `main.ipynb`.
- `Bandit.py`: The original file given by my professor as a homework assignment.
